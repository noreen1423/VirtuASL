# VirtuASL
This project presents innovative gloves designed to represent sign language in virtual reality (VR), enabling the Deaf community to fully participate in VR environments. These gloves seamlessly integrate physical sign language gestures with digital communication, enhancing accessibility and interaction within VR spaces. Aimed at fostering inclusivity, they ensure that deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals can engage with VR just like they can in real life. A focus on affordability allows this technology to be accessible to the average consumer. This initiative is a significant step towards creating more inclusive and accessible VR technologies for all users.
