# VirtuASL
This innovative project introduces a method for representing sign language within virtual reality
(VR), facilitating the integration of the Deaf community into VR environments. By seamlessly merging
physical sign language gestures with digital hand models, this solution enhances accessibility and
interaction within VR realms. With a commitment to affordability, this technology aims to make VR
accessible to a wider audience, ensuring that deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals can engage with VR
experiences just as they would in real-life scenarios. This type of development would finally allow the
Deaf community to begin to participate in virtual reality with all that it has to offer. Whether it be through
video games and entertainment, to VR workplaces and therapy treatments. This initiative represents a
crucial stride toward the development of more inclusive and accessible VR technologies for all users.
